# hello-world
This is my first git repository for some learning and tinckering

Hi, everybody!

I'm very excited to finally take some time to learn how to use github properly!!
I've used it poorly a couple of times ago, but now I'm decided to not only put some of projects over here, but also on contributing to the open source community.
I'm just another humble student, eager to learn and excited about helping others as well!
